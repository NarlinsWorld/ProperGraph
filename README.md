<h1>Simple Math XY graph for Processing</h1>
<p>I decided to write this sketch because I was forever wanting to look
at some xy plot of data or of a function.  If that were my goal exclusively,
I would not choose Processing and especially not JAVA as the language to use.
However, there is a good reason to use Processing, namely, it permits sketching
mathematical ideas and quickly viewing results that are nicely animated. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the graphics onscreen are not mathematically nice, with the
y-axis being upside down and requiring the use of pixel values to color a pixel.
This software is a first step at allowing a user to think in the right side up
math world, but still view results through processing.</p>

<p>Currently, the documentation is inside a tab within the processing code file.
Even though the code is public, it is not planned for much further development.  
Therefore, full documentation is not forseen at this time.</p>
